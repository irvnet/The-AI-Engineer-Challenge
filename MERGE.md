## 🔍 Pre-Merge Checklist

Before merging, ensure:

- [ ] **All tests pass**: RAG functionality works end-to-end
- [ ] **No breaking changes**: Regular chat still functions
- [ ] **Dependencies updated**: All new packages are in requirements
- [ ] **Documentation updated**: README reflects new features
- [ ] **Code reviewed**: Self-review completed
- [ ] **Branch follows rules**: Created feature branch as per Cursor rules

## 🎯 Post-Merge Steps

After successful merge:

1. **Switch to main:**
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git pull origin main
   ```

2. **Verify deployment:**
   - Deploy to Vercel
   - Test PDF upload and RAG chat in production
   - Verify all functionality works as expected

3. **Clean up:**
   ```bash
   # Delete local branch
   git branch -d s03-assignment
   
   # Delete remote branch (if not done by PR)
   git push origin --delete s03-assignment
   ```

## 🚨 Important Notes

- **Environment Variables**: Ensure `OPENAI_API_KEY` is set in production
- **File Upload Limits**: Vercel has file size limits for uploads
- **Session Storage**: RAG sessions are in-memory and will reset on server restart
- **API Key Security**: Frontend passes API key to backend for processing
